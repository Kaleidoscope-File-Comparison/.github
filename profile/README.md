## About Kaleidoscope
Kaleidoscope is a sophisticated file comparison application designed for developers, writers, and professionals who need to analyze differences between files, folders, and document versions. It provides a visually clear and functionally rich environment for comparing text, images, and directory structures, with particular strength in handling merge conflicts and code review workflows. The application addresses the limitations of basic diff tools by offering intuitive visual representations of changes, powerful merge capabilities, and seamless integration with development workflows, making complex comparisons understandable and manageable even for large or intricate file differences.

The application excels in its presentation of differences and its integration with broader development ecosystems. Text comparisons highlight changes at character-level precision with syntax highlighting for programming languages, while image comparisons use overlay and difference visualization techniques. The three-way merge interface simplifies conflict resolution by clearly showing the original version alongside conflicting changes. Integration with command-line tools, version control systems, and other applications through URL schemes and automation enables workflow efficiency. For developers reviewing code changes, technical writers comparing document revisions, or designers evaluating image variations, Kaleidoscope provides professional-grade comparison tools that enhance accuracy and save time in review processes.
